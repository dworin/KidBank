Kidbank is a local application for managing bank checking and savings accounts.  

The user interface tries to replicate the user interface of the terminal a bank teller would use in the 1980s or 1990s.  It is a text based interface where the user uses keystrokes to interact.

All data is stored locally in an SQLITE database.

The application is run locally in a terminal.

Kidbank supports basic banking transactions including account creation, deposits, and withdrawls.
